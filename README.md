# ML + DP (Machine Learning + Differential Privacy Project)

This project explores how to combine Machine Learning techniques with
Differential Privacy to protect sensitive data. The goal is to demonstrate
how noise can be added to model training or query outputs while still
maintaining useful accuracy.

## Features
- Load and process datasets
- Train a simple ML classifier
- Apply Laplace noise for differential privacy
- Compare accuracy with and without DP
- Visualize distributions of DP noise

## Requirements
Install dependencies:
